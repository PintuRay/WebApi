=> Step 1: Download Redis for Windows
		Visit the Redis for Windows GitHub repository: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis
		Click on the "releases" tab and choose the latest release (or the version you wish to install).
		Download the zip file containing the binaries (for example, Redis-x64-<version>.zip).
=> Step 2: Extract the Redis binaries
	 Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the zip file to a folder of your choice. For example, you can extract it to C:\Redis.
=> Step 3: Install Redis as a Windows service
		Open a command prompt (cmd) with administrative privileges.
		Navigate to the Redis folder you extracted earlier, for example: cd C:\Redis.
		To install Redis as a service, run the following command: redis-server --service-install redis.windows-service.conf. This will use the configuration file provided with the binaries.
		You should receive a message indicating that Redis has been successfully installed as a service.
=>  Step 4: Start Redis service
	To start the Redis service, run the following command: redis-server --service-start.
	You should receive a message indicating that the Redis service has been started.
=> Step 5: Verify Redis installation
	In the command prompt, run the Redis CLI by typing redis-cli and pressing Enter.
	To check if Redis is running, type ping and press Enter. If Redis is running, it will return "PONG".
	You can also run other Redis commands to interact with the server, such as SET key value and GET key.
